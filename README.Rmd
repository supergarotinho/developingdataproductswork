# Developing Data Products Work

In this ptoject, we developed a shiny application that predicts the Miles Per Gallon consumption of a car based in some features of it. These set of features where selected based on how easy is for the user to collect them.

## The features are:

* Number of cylinders
* Gross horsepower
* Weight (lb)
* Number of forward gears
* The transmission type: Automatic or Manual

## How the prediction model was created

* We used the mtcars dataset from the dataset package in R  
* Use used the linear regression model in R  

## The mtcars dataset

_The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models)._
